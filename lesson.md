# SQL Sprint Project

## Welcome

In this sprint, your team has been hired as Database Engineers for **SummerTides Festival**. Your objective is to design, build, and query a relational database that helps the festival organizers manage attendees, artists, performances, vendors, sponsors, and ticket sales.

This project combines all the SQL concepts covered in class into one real-world application. Work collaboratively within your assigned group, ensuring that every member contributes to both the database design and SQL queries.

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this sprint, you should be able to:

* Design a relational database from a real-world scenario.
* Create databases and tables using appropriate data types.
* Define Primary Keys and Foreign Keys to enforce relationships.
* Apply constraints such as `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and `DEFAULT`.
* Insert realistic sample data into related tables.
* Retrieve information using `SELECT`.
* Filter and sort data using different SQL clauses.
* Use aggregate functions to generate reports.
* Join multiple tables to answer business questions.
* Create reusable Views for commonly accessed information.

---

# Project Rules

* Write clean, well-commented SQL.
* Use meaningful table and column names.
* Every SQL file should contain only the tasks for that topic.
* All scripts should execute without errors.
* Include comments before every exercise explaining what the query is intended to accomplish.
* Commit your work regularly if using Git.

---

# Part 1 – Create the Database

**File:** `01_create_database.sql`

Create a new database called **summertides**.

After creating it:

* Switch into the database.
* Verify that it exists.
* Add comments explaining what the script does.

---

# Part 2 – Create the Tables

**File:** `02_create_tables.sql`

Create all tables required for the festival database.

Your schema should include:

* Attendees
* Tickets
* Artists
* Stages
* Performances
* Vendors
* Sales
* Sponsors
* Stage Sponsors

For every table:

* Choose appropriate data types.
* Create a Primary Key.
* Add Foreign Keys where relationships exist.
* Apply suitable constraints (`NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, etc.).
* Ensure relationships accurately represent the business scenario.

Before writing SQL, sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing how the tables connect.

---

# Part 3 – Populate the Database

**File:** `03_insert_data.sql`

Insert realistic sample data into every table.

Minimum requirements:

* 20 attendees
* 15 artists
* 6 stages
* 30 performances
* 40 tickets
* 10 vendors
* 50 sales
* 8 sponsors

Your data should be believable and demonstrate the relationships between tables. For example:

* Different ticket types
* Artists performing on different stages
* Multiple vendors making sales
* Sponsors supporting different stages

---

# Part 4 – Basic Queries

**File:** `05_select.sql`

Retrieve information from individual tables.

Complete queries that:

1. Display all attendees.
2. Display all artists.
3. Display only attendee names and email addresses.
4. Display only unique cities where attendees come from.
5. Rename columns using aliases.
6. Retrieve all ticket types.
7. Display all vendors.
8. Display all stages.

Use:

* `SELECT`
* `SELECT *`
* `DISTINCT`
* Aliases (`AS`)

---

# Part 5 – Filtering Data

**File:** `06_filtering.sql`

Answer the following business questions:

1. Show attendees older than 25.
2. Find attendees from Nairobi.
3. Display VIP tickets only.
4. Show tickets costing more than 5,000.
5. Find artists from Kenya.
6. Display vendors with ratings above 4.
7. Find attendees whose names start with "A".
8. Display performances happening between 6:00 PM and 10:00 PM.
9. Show tickets purchased on a specific date.
10. Find attendees whose phone numbers are missing.

Use:

* `WHERE`
* `AND`
* `OR`
* `NOT`
* `BETWEEN`
* `LIKE`
* `IN`
* `IS NULL`

---

# Part 6 – Sorting and Limiting Results

**File:** `07_order_limit.sql`

Write queries that:

1. Display attendees alphabetically.
2. Show artists ordered by genre.
3. List vendors from highest to lowest rating.
4. Display the five most expensive ticket purchases.
5. Show the first ten attendees registered.
6. Display the latest ticket purchases.
7. Retrieve only the top three highest-rated vendors.

Use:

* `ORDER BY`
* `ASC`
* `DESC`
* `LIMIT`
* `OFFSET` (optional)

---

# Part 7 – CASE Statements

**File:** `08_case.sql`

Create calculated columns using `CASE`.

Examples include:

1. Categorise ticket prices as Budget, Standard, or VIP.
2. Classify attendees as Youth, Adult, or Senior based on age.
3. Categorise vendor ratings as Excellent, Good, or Needs Improvement.
4. Label artists as Local or International based on country.

Every query should include both the original value and the newly created category.

---

# Part 8 – Aggregate Functions and Grouping

**File:** `09_group_by.sql`

Generate reports for the festival organisers.

Answer questions such as:

1. How many attendees are registered?
2. What is the average ticket price?
3. What is the highest and lowest ticket price?
4. How many attendees come from each city?
5. How many artists belong to each genre?
6. What is the total sales amount for each vendor?
7. Which festival day sold the most tickets?
8. Display only vendors whose total sales exceed a chosen amount.

Use:

* `COUNT()`
* `SUM()`
* `AVG()`
* `MIN()`
* `MAX()`
* `GROUP BY`
* `HAVING`

---

# Part 9 – Joins

**File:** `10_joins.sql`

Combine information from multiple tables to answer business questions.

Write queries that:

1. Display attendees together with their ticket information.
2. Show artists and the stages where they perform.
3. Display every performance together with the artist name and stage name.
4. List every vendor together with the attendees who purchased from them.
5. Display sponsors alongside the stages they sponsor.
6. Show artists who do not yet have a scheduled performance (if applicable).
7. Retrieve all performances for a selected festival day.

* `INNER JOIN`
* `LEFT JOIN`
* Multiple-table joins

# Part 10 – Views

**File:** `11_views.sql`

Create at least three views:

### `vip_attendees`

Display all attendees who purchased VIP tickets.

### `artist_schedule`

Display:

* Artist name
* Stage
* Performance date
* Start time
* End time

### `vendor_sales_summary`

Display:

* Vendor name
* Total sales
* Average sale value
* Number of transactions

After creating each view, query it to verify that it works correctly.

# Part 11 – Bonus Challenges

**File:** `12_bonus.sql`

Answer advanced business questions.

Examples include:

* Which artist performs the most?
* Which stage hosts the highest number of performances?
* Which vendor generated the highest revenue?
* Which attendee spent the most money?
* Which city has the highest number of attendees?
* Which festival day generated the highest ticket revenue?
* Which sponsor contributed the most funding?
* What is the total expected ticket revenue?
* Which ticket type was purchased the most?

Challenge yourselves to answer at least **five** of these questions using combinations of joins, filtering, grouping, and aggregate functions.
